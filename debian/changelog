   - Made the tests be 100% coverage on a per library source file.

     not complete).

   - Put the hide-warnings utility in the tools/* folder.

  * Added an ./mk script to recompile quickly.
  * Added a coverage script.
  * Added in=C++ to the MAPPING_EXTENSION (Doxygen).

    outputting usage even though they otherwise get sorted now.
