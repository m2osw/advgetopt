advgetopt (2.0.0.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Reorganized the project to incorporate the snap_config.cpp/h.
   - Renamed "src" to "advgetopt" so #include are all correct.
   - Broke up the large advgetopt.cpp single file in many sub-objects/files.
   - Made exceptions derive from our libexcept::exception_t class.
   - Moved the version declaration in a separate header.
   - Bumped version to 2.0 (it won't exactly be compatible with 1.x anymore.)
   - Broke up the unit tests in many files to make it easier to manage.
   - Made the tests be 100% coverage on a per library source file.
   - Updated the tests to use snapcatch2.
   - Removed all the exit() calls. usage() now returns a string.
   - Added many %<flag> to help with listing various parameters.
   - Added a logger which by defaults prints in stderr.
   - Changed the options structure and added an environment_options one.
   - Added templates to fill the structures with a better chance of testing
     invalid parameters at compile time (although without at least C++17 it is
     not complete).
   - Added system command line options (i.e. --help, --version, ...).
   - Put the hide-warnings utility in the tools/* folder.
   - Replaced validation of parameters with validators. We have an integer
     and a regex validator for now. Plans is to also have one for addr and
     libtld (i.e. domain names, emails.)
  * Added missing BOOST dependency in the CMakeLists.txt.
  * Added an ./mk script to recompile quickly.
  * Added a coverage script.
  * Added in=C++ to the MAPPING_EXTENSION (Doxygen).
  * Added a grouping mechanism so we can keep options in groups when
    outputting usage even though they otherwise get sorted now.
