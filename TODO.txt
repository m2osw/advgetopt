* Further test that he variables support works (in the getopt_info and such.)

* A section name in a file is totally ignored if no parameters are added.
  In some cases, we may want to know that the user created such a section.
  (i.e. that happens in the iplock definitions for the ipload.)

      [section::header]

      [section::early_content]
      after = header

* Add a test to verify that '\n' is correctly handled on small strings
  (we had the case in our fluid-settings / GUI --help where the string would
  wrap just a little and the wrap part + Environment variable was less than
  what would fit one line...)

* Confirm that all the configuration functionality from snapwebsites is available

* I had an idea which would be to make the validators plugins. One potential
  advantage is that since we don't use them much, they could be loaded on an
  as-needed basis. At the same time, it makes their implementation more
  complicated.

* Finish up on the ARRAY implementation:
** Add tests
