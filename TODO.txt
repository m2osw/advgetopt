* Re-run all the tests with the variables addition it won't pass as I made
  subtle changes to some exceptions and such.
* Further test that he variables support works (in the getopt_info and such.)

* Add a test to verify that '\n' is correctly handled on small strings
  (we had the case in our fluid-settings / GUI --help where the string would
  wrap just a little and the wrap part + Environment variable was less than
  what would fit one line...)

* Confirm that all the configuration functionality from snapwebsites is available
* Look into a way to support TOML, it's like ".ini" with a few extensions
  https://github.com/toml-lang/toml (more types, repeated sections as arrays)
* The output of --help can be saved in a stringstream so we know how large it
  is and if larger than one screen, we can pass the result to `less` (we also
  want to make sure isatty() is true and that less is indeed accessible)
* Look at keeping the comments when editing a configuration file.
