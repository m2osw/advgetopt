* Confirm that all the configuration functionality from snapwebsites is available
* Support the equal sign for long parameter (i.e. `--config=/file/name`)

* Look into breaking up the existing tests, especially since some of the old functionality was removed and the concept of re-testing the same options later is not useful.
* Finish up the unit tests to at least cover 100% of the code.


* Reorganize the unit tests by functionality

** DONE
*** version.cpp -- check the library version
*** options_files.cpp -- check the loading of options from a file
*** options_parser.cpp -- check all possibilities in the parser (need more error checking in lib. though)

** Work Required
*** arguments.cpp -- test command line options covering all cases, valid/invalid
*** valid_config_files.cpp -- (1) fix name (2) move errors if somewhere else (3) make sure we cover 100%

** Move to other tests
*** valid_config_files_extra.cpp -- what's that?!
*** logic_errors.cpp -- remove once we confirm that those 2 tests are done somewhere else
*** invalid_parameters.cpp -- remove once those tests are somewhere else
