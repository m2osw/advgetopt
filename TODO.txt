* Confirm that all the configuration functionality from snapwebsites is available
* Support the equal sign for long parameter (i.e. `--config=/file/name`)
* Add default _system_ command line options
** --help
** --version
** --license
** --copyright
** --build-date
** --environment-variable-name
** --configuration-filenames
** --options-filename

* Finish up the unit tests to at least cover 100% of the code.
