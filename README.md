# advgetopt
Provides the advgetopt::getopt class, which parses command line options (from  argc/argv). It is very advanced and is capable to read many different  types of options with a letter (-h) and a word (--verbose) with no parameters,  one parameter, any number of parameters, and a set of "filenames." Also,  entries can be read from the command line, the environment and/or a config  file.
