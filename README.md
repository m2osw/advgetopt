# Introduction

The `advgetopt` library provides the `advgetopt::getopt` class, which
parses command line options (from argc/argv). It is very advanced and
is capable of reading many different types of options with a letter
(-h) and a word (--verbose) with no parameters, one parameter, any
number of parameters, and a set of "filenames," parameters without
a flag first.

The class accepts input from the command line, an environment variable,
and configuration files.
